Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Arizona.

My research interests are in **health economics** and **labor economics**. My current work studies the effect of health insurance on birth outcomes, accounting for substitution between public and private health insurance.

I received my M.A. in Economics and B.S. in Agriculture from the University of Tokyo.

You can contact me at [mikeda\@arizona.edu](mailto:%20mikeda@arizona.edu).
